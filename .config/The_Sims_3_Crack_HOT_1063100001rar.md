The Indian censor board initially refused to grant a certificate to Raajneeti, a political thriller directed by Prakash Jha. The board claimed that the film's lead character, portrayed by Katrina Kaif, was based on the real-life personalities of Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party, and Rabri Devi, the former chief minister of Bihar and the head of the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Jha denied this accusation and stated that his film was inspired solely by Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic that depicts a dynastic struggle for power.[37] The film also faced censorship for its references to electronic voting machines, which were seen as controversial in the context of Indian elections. Moreover, the board objected to some scenes that implied that women had to make sexual compromises to advance in politics, as well as some crude dialogues that stereotyped the Muslim community. The film also contained scenes of graphic violence that were deemed unsuitable for younger audiences. After making several cuts and modifications, Jha finally received a U/A certificate for his film, which means that it can be watched by anyone under parental guidance.[38]

Raajneeti was released on 4 June 2010 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The film was praised for its gripping storyline, powerful performances, and realistic portrayal of Indian politics. The film also became a commercial success, grossing over â¹1.45 billion worldwide and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2010.[39]
  
The film's ensemble cast included Ajay Devgn, Ranbir Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Arjun Rampal, Manoj Bajpayee, Naseeruddin Shah, and Sarah Thompson in addition to Katrina Kaif. The film's characters were loosely based on the characters from Mahabharata, such as Krishna, Arjuna, Karna, Duryodhana, Bhishma, and Draupadi. The film also drew parallels with the contemporary political scenario in India, such as the Gandhi family's dominance, the caste-based politics of Bihar, and the rise of regional parties.[40]
  
Raajneeti was also nominated for several awards and won some of them. The film won four Filmfare Awards, including Best Director for Prakash Jha and Best Supporting Actor for Arjun Rampal. The film also won two National Film Awards, including Best Audiography and Best Screenplay. Katrina Kaif received a special mention from the jury for her performance as Indu Pratap.[41]
  
Raajneeti also faced some controversies and legal issues before and after its release. The film was accused of plagiarizing the script of the 2006 Hollywood film The Departed, which was itself a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Jha denied the allegations and said that his film was an original work.[42]
  
The film also sparked protests from some political parties and groups who felt that the film was defaming their leaders or communities. The Congress Party objected to the portrayal of Katrina Kaif's character as a foreign-born woman who becomes a political leader, while the Rashtriya Janata Dal claimed that the film was maligning their chief Rabri Devi. Some Muslim groups also protested against the film for showing a Muslim character as a terrorist. Jha defended his film and said that it was not intended to hurt anyone's sentiments.[43]
  
Raajneeti was also banned in some states and countries due to its sensitive content. The film was banned in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh for allegedly inciting violence and communal hatred. The film was also banned in Nepal for showing a negative image of the country and its people. Jha appealed to the authorities and managed to get the bans lifted after making some changes in the film.[44]
