# How to Download and Install SPSS Statistics 17 for Free
 
SPSS Statistics 17 is a powerful software for statistical analysis and data management. It can help you perform various tasks such as descriptive statistics, regression, ANOVA, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and more. However, SPSS Statistics 17 is not a free software and you need a license code to activate it. If you don't have a license code, you might be tempted to look for a keygen or a crack online. But be careful, because these methods are illegal and risky. You might end up with a virus or malware on your computer, or face legal consequences for software piracy.

So, how can you download and install SPSS Statistics 17 for free without breaking the law? The answer is simple: use the trial version. The trial version of SPSS Statistics 17 allows you to use the software for 14 days without a license code. You can download it from the official website of IBM SPSS[^1^]. You just need to fill out a form with your name, email address, and country. Then, you will receive an email with a link to download the trial version. You can also choose the language and the operating system of your preference.
 
Once you have downloaded the trial version, you can install it on your computer by following these steps:
 
1. Double-click on the downloaded file to start the installation wizard.
2. Accept the license agreement and click Next.
3. Select the destination folder and click Next.
4. Select the features you want to install and click Next.
5. Click Install to begin the installation process.
6. Wait for the installation to complete and click Finish.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed SPSS Statistics 17 on your computer. You can now launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a window asking you to enter a license code or start the trial period. Choose the second option and click OK. You can now use SPSS Statistics 17 for free for 14 days.
 
However, keep in mind that after 14 days, your trial period will expire and you will not be able to use SPSS Statistics 17 anymore. If you want to continue using it, you will need to purchase a license code from IBM SPSS[^2^]. The price depends on the edition and the number of users you need. Alternatively, you can look for other free or cheaper alternatives to SPSS Statistics 17, such as PSPP[^3^], R[^4^], or Excel[^5^]. These software can also perform statistical analysis and data management, but they might have different features and interfaces than SPSS Statistics 17.
 
In conclusion, SPSS Statistics 17 is a great software for statistical analysis and data management, but it is not free. You can download and install it for free for 14 days using the trial version, but after that you will need to buy a license code or switch to another software. Do not try to use a keygen or a crack to activate SPSS Statistics 17, because they are illegal and risky. Stay safe and enjoy your statistics!
